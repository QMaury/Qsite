		<h2>Cold Dark Place (EP)</h2>
		<h5>~~Mastodon~~2017~~</h5>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			This is an album that I bought during a few weeks when I was without smartphone or PC, 
			and my only way of finding new music was buying CDs at the record store based completely
			on what the cover looked like. This contributed to the magical first few listens of this EP.<br><br>
			Cold Dark Place is characterized with a unique eerie, gloomy sound and sad introspective lyrics.
			The instruments and vocals combine to make a strange 'end-of-days' aesthetic that I don't hear too often in
			music. The entire EP has the sound of a man at the end of his rope; fears, regrets and misfortunes 
			amounting to create a beautiful, hopeless atmosphere.<br><br>
			This is likely my favorite Mastodon release due to it's short listening time, palpable atmosphere, and
			impressively cohesive aesthetic.
