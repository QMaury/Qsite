		<h2>Even In The Quietest Moments...</h2>
		<h5>~~Supertramp~~1977~~</h5>
		<br><br>
		<p>
			This one took me a while to get to, both to listen to and to write about. Now that I'm
			here, I realize that it's perfect for this format. Short, coherent, and understated.
			<br><br>
			Each song on this album is like a different facet of our protagonist's experience, which when seen
			as a whole paints a picture of a disillusioned artist longing for some kind of enlightenment. Even though
			these songs are all based off very specific life experiences, it all strikes a chord with me. Supertramp
			has a way of speaking to the creative in me and stir up universal feelings. To bottle up a little piece
			of the human experience and to deliver it in album form. In other words, he is literally me.
			<br><br>
			At first I didn't like this album, but given a little love and patience, Even In The Quietest Moments revealed
			it's gifts.
