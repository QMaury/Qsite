 <p>
  &emsp;&emsp;The state of modern web design is a thing that I look upon with disgust.<br>
It is actually baffling to me how few the amount of people that share this<br>
opinion is, but put simply, modern web design and the ideology that surro-<br>
unds it is awful.<br><br>


<h4>/* PART 1: LACK OF SIMPLICITY */</h4>

<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;The way that I design websites -- the way that I designed the website y-<br>
ou are most likely reading this on right now -- have a very clear vision<br>
to be as simple and easy to navigate as possible. No un-needed trackers, <br>
no un-needed cookies, no un-needed scripts. No fat. Content and readabili-<br>
ty first, everything else second.
<br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;This vision for web-design, or lack thereof, is what I think is wrong <br>
with the modern web.<br>
<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;It appears to me that a lot of web designers these days are in it to put<br>
some pretty pictures on a screen and get money from advertisers. They see<br>
the word 'design' in the title of 'web-designer' and think of of a graphi-<br>
cal designer instead of what they should be thinking of, an architectural<br>
designer. Your job should be to make sure that everything is as readable <br>
and easy-to-find as possible. A good web designer does not make his job <br>
known. Good web design should be as invisible as possible.
<br>
<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;Perhaps a client will ask for things that sacrifice your vision of simp-<br>
licity. Perhaps you should put your foot down and tell the client that so-<br>
mething is a bad idea.<br>
<br>
  &emsp;&emsp;A good web designer should make a website as easy to navigate as possib-<br>
le. A great web designer can have a good looking website, with no cost to<br>
the core vision. <br><br>



<h4>/* PART 2: TEACHING OF WEB-DESIGN */</h4>

<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;The issue of teaching web design in a school setting follows closely wi-<br>
th the issue discussed in the previous section. A lot of people hired for<br>
teaching positions in web design lack the K.I.S.S* ideology that is oh-so-<br>
-important for creating a good website.<br>
<p>
*Keep It Simple, Stupid!<br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;The web design teacher of the modern day, while not actively malicious,<br>
fails to mention the idea that web design should be kept as simple as pos-<br>
sible.<br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;This is not the worst thing that they could be doing (as they could be <br>
actively teaching against keeping things simple), but it is still not good<br>
to fail to mention something so crucial to students.<br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;Another large problem with the entire education system as a whole, is th-<br>
at for some students, the environment of having a teacher tell you what to<br>
do with the threat of bad grades, and by extension an unsuccessful life is<br>
not very conducive to learning and stifles both creativity and morale.<br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;While web design (and usage of a computer as a whole) is fun to experime-<br>
nt and play around with, the wrong environment can completely spoil a stud-<br>
ent's opinion of things. Students should receive guidance to get them going<br>
at first, but then I think they should just be left to their own devices <br>
and revel in the joy of creation. <br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;A more broad solution is to just offer more choice and more freedom for <br>
students to find what works best for them, as having a teacher breathe down<br>
their neck truly does work better for some, and should not be taken away c-<br>
ompletely if it really does help some learn.<br>
<br>
<h4>/* PART 3: CONCLUSION (tl;dr) */</h4>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;Modern web design should be kept simple and effective. Functionality sho-<br>
uld always come before aesthetics or monetary gain.<br>
<p>
  &emsp;&emsp;The education system should offer more choice to students to create an e-<br>
nvironment more conducive to learning and creativity.<br>
