  I posit that there is no real ego. a person's identity is completely dependant<br>
on the surroundings and a person's physical body is inextricably connected to<br>
the world and ecosystem.  When a person is born they are essentially a blank<br>
slate. Before a person has had any experiences, nothing is yet determined as to<br>
how they will act in life. As far as mental pathways go, instinctive thoughts,<br>
personality, interests, identity, a person is a blank slate.<br><br>

  A blank slate person is easily persuaded and malleable. Blank slate years are<br>
the most formative. A person will grow up instilled with the rights and wrongs,<br>
social and ethical customs, accents, behavioural patterns, political and<br>
religious beliefs and the sense of humour of where they grew up and who they<br>
grew up with.<br><br>

  If you've tried imagining what your life would be like had the conditions of<br>
your birth been different, you probably already came to the answer of "Yes, I<br>
would essentially be a totally different person, had I been born in Ireland."<br>
Now we are seeing just how dependant the ego is on the surrounding world. Taking<br>
that idea a step further, how different are other people to you? Who's to say<br>
that this the rambling homeless man down the street couldn't have been a<br>
coworker, had he not been evicted from his house. Who's to say that you couldn't<br>
have been a pro wrestler,had your pathway in life been slightly different?<br><br>

  Knowing this, if we really want to understand people better, you can't treat<br>
them fully as individuals. People are products of the place they grew up in<br>
and the people they grew up around in the time period they grew up in. You know<br>
the golden rule of "Treat people the way you want to be treated"? Well, that's<br>
because you're always closer to people than you think. Everyone is all made of<br>
the same stuff, and we're all related, so you need to be more understanding when<br>
someone holds a perspective that they literally can't help having. A person's<br>
perspective of the world is based solely on the literal *perspective* they were<br>
born with. We are all the same, experiencing life from different angles.<br><br><br>



  "So, you're suggesting that everyone is the same?" Yes. I am suggesting that<br>
everyone is actually the same, experiencing life from a different angle, but it<br>
goes deeper than that. To explain my thoughts on the ego better we're gonna have<br>
to talk about consciousness; what it is, how it works, and my own personal<br>
theories.<br><br>

  What is consciousness? Well, it's just the ability to think and feel and live<br>
in the moment. I know that I have consciousness because I am currently thinking<br>
thoughts. That's all it takes to know you are conscious -- ask yourself, 'am I<br>
thinking right now?' and if the answer is anything, then yes, you are conscious.<br>
Wow, cool! Now I know how to find out if I am conscious, but how do I find out<br>
if someone <i>else</i> is conscious? How do I know  that my friends aren't<br>
philosophical <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zombies/" target="_blank" >zombies</a>? Well, that's where it gets tricky. You see, the<br>
method you used to determine that <i>you</i> are conscious involved you<br>
analyzing <i>your own</i> thought process and your own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia" target="_blank">qualia</a>, but that's<br>
not really possible when trying to determine someone else's consciousness. You<br>
can't just step into someone's perspective and see what it's like to be them,<br>
nor can you just ask them because if someone lacked consciousness, they<br>
wouldn't know; they would always behave as a normal thinking, feeling human.<br>
Just to reiterate, a philosophical zombie wouldn't do things because they<br>
<i>feel</i> like doing something, they do things essentially because they are<br>
programmed to do so. Think of a person with no consciousness as a biological<br>
machine.<br><br>

  To make matters worse, a conscious brain and an unconscious brain are<br>
completely identical down to a molecular level (I'll write another post<br>
explaining my thoughts on this particular detail at some point). A Voight-Kampff<br>
machine won't help you here. Scientists have not figured out what parts of the<br>
brain cause consciousness, if any. A person with consciousness is<br>
<i>completely</i> indistinguishable from a person without. <br><br>

  If we can't prove someone to be either conscious nor unconscious, I think we<br>
should just give everyone the benefit of the doubt and say that every human<br>
has consciousness. We have no other information that could disprove this, and<br>
it's more inclusive, so why not? But now that we're assuming all people to<br>
have consciousness, that opens the door to a bunch of other new questions. Do<br>
animals have consciousness? Being able to speak or read or do anything human<br>
isn't necessarily a requirement for consciousness. I guess by that logic, all<br>
animals would have to have a consciousness too. But what about inanimate<br>
objects?? What about the ground beneath my feet, or keyboard I type on, or the<br>
walls around me, or the universe itself? This is where it gets really weird;<br>
Yes.<br><br><br>



  Buddhist teachings speak of an eternal and endlessly repetitive life cycle in<br>
which all living things exist. Everytime an organism dies, they are<br>
essentially recycled by the universe, becoming something new.  You're living<br>
as a human right now, but following your death, your body may fertilize a tree<br>
that will be chopped down and turned into a coffee table.  After a few<br>
decades, you are thrown out, turned to sawdust and finally baked into a bread<br>
for children in concentration camps to eat.<br><br>

  All things in the universe interact, add on to, recontextualize and give<br>
meaning to each other, but never actually categorically different. Everything is<br>
still all part of the same compost pile.  Just how people are blank slates<br>
experiencing life from different angles, the same is true for everything else in<br>
the universe.<br><br><br>



  We know the saying of '<i>you are what you eat</i>', but rarely do we think<br>
about that <i>literally</i>. You literally are what you eat. You absorb the<br>
nutrients from food and drink and then those nutrients literally become part of<br>
you. The parts your body doesn't absorb is then expelled from the body, this<br>
waste then returning to the earth, decomposing, absorbsing into the environment,<br>
becoming one with the Earth. The nutrients from that waste then go on to<br>
fertilize plants that you will again eat to continue the cycle. This is true for<br>
everything in the universe. <br><br>

  Everything is constantly being recycled to form something new, and best part,<br>
there isn't even anything supernatural about this.  When people think about<br>
reincarnation, they think of the soul archons and Karmic scoreboards<br>
all-powerful deities in charge of what happens to people's souls, but those are<br>
just metaphorical interpretations of actual completely observable natural<br>
processes.<br><br>

  Reincarnation, in a literal sense is just what happens to you after death.<br>
Instead of a deity deciding your next life, it's nature; taking in the nutrients<br>
from your body, having them absorbed back into the world, and then used to make<br>
something new. The remains of your body and countless others will then go on to<br>
fertilize food for our descendants to then feed upon, become bedrock for a<br>
civilization to live on top of, and trees for our descendants to build a house<br>
with. Just to reiterate: This is constantly on-going.  Nothing is static,<br>
everything is fluid, constantly changing, constantly becoming something new.<br><br><br>



  What to make of all this? What is the takeaway? I guess the takeaway should be<br>
to make sure you're going through this life leaving things better than before.<br>
Everyone you know and everything you see is deserving of the same kindness you<br>
should treat yourself with and you have the power to affect all of it with your<br>
actions. Your current actions will have ramifications on yourself, others, the<br>
world and the universe, so better to leave it better than you found it.<br><br>
