        <h1>The Unknowable Nature of Reality and Its Relation to Human
          Consciousness</h1>
 Octavio "qms" Maury, March 17, 2022

 <u><a href="egodeath-psychoactivedrugs.txt">plaintext version of this essay</a></u>
 <br>
 <br>
 <p>True reality is uncertain and altered states of consciousness should be
 studied<br>
 to help us gain a better understanding of our existence.<br><br>

How do I know what I know? I know that I am typing on my keyboard right now<br>

because I can see, feel, and hear my keyboard in front of me and my fingers<br>

interacting with it. I remember turning on my computer and opening the text file<br>

you're reading. But knowing that human senses are fallable, how do I know if I<br>

even have fingers? Sure, I can feel and see and touch my fingers, but senses<br>

depend on electrical pulses that could theoretically be replicated by a machine.<br>

If I can have a dream where I become a butterfly and can truly believe myself to<br>

be a butterfly, it could also be possible that I could falsely believe myself to<br>

have fingers.<br>
<br>


Given enough computing power, we could create a program within a supercomputer<br>

that thinks that it's a real human in a real world. I could equip this simulated<br>

person with fake memories, and in it's head, it would think that they have lived<br>

a whole life, when actually the simulation could only have been running for a<br>

few seconds.<br><br>



Knowing this, we are faced with a question. How are we to know that our reality<br>

isn't simulated? How do I know that my entire reality isn't just another person<br>

dreaming? How do I know that anything exists?  These kinds of questions the<br>

philosophical branch of epistemology; the study of knowing. How do we know what<br>

we know? Well, the long and short of it is that we can't know how we know<br>

anything. We can't know anything for sure.<br>
<br>


Some claim to have gained a better understanding of reality through
       accessing<br>
       altered states of consciousness. Through different means, whether it be<br>
       meditation, holotropic breathwork, or psychoactive drugs, people can achieve<br>
       something called 'ego death' -- Death of the self. Ego death is a spiritual<br>
       experience described as a "complete loss of subjective self-identity". When<br>
experiencing ego death, one loses their sense of identity. Living normally
with<br>
the ego, one experiences life through a subjective perspective. You only
know<br>
reality from the perspective of a human, because that's just what your ego<br>
allows you to experience, but letting go of the ego will allow you to
observe<br>
objective reality, free from any subjectivism blocking your conscience.<br>
Individuals who have experienced this are left with the thinking that the
entire<br>
universe is just one interconnected system, and that every person is somehow<br>
metaphysically linked to each other. LSD users can realize that the entirety
of<br>
everything is 'just one consciousness observing itself from different<br>
perspectives'. On higher doses of LSD, you begin to see eyes everywhere.
You're<br>
looking at the walls and the walls are looking at you, then you realize you
and<br>
the walls are the same and you're just looking at yourself.  Some DMT users
who<br>
experience ego death, come back from the experience feeling that their DMT
trip<br>
felt "more real" than their usual existence. The experience felt like
pulling<br>
back the curtains on reality and seeing the real thing.<br><br>

So-called 'spiritual' phenomena are very often disregarded by scientists and<br>
formal researchers (which isn't necessarily unreasonable), but there could<br>
really be something of value in studying these kinds of experiences. Let's
say<br>
that these kinds of experiences are truthful, and they do provide some kind
of<br>
insight to the universe, it's reasonable to think it would be handy for
humanity<br>
as a whole to have a sort of 'meta-game' guide to reality.  We could get a
lot<br>
more done with a lot less conflict. Through a better understanding of these<br>
philosophical and meta-philosophical ideas, humanity could better work
together<br>
to a common goal. These sorts of spiritual phenomena could help us better<br>
understand of our definition of right and wrong, better understand
ourselves,<br>
and better understand the universe we live in.<br><br>
