 =================================================================================<br><br>

 Fuck. <i>Fuck!</i> There he is again. Watching. <i>Watching</i>.<br>
<br>
Attempting sleep is useless. I still feel his presence. The room is pitch black;<br>
There is no moon tonight. I shouldn't be able to see him. <br><br>

Am I dreaming? Somebody kick me out of my head. I'm losing it. The droning is<br>
getting louder.<br><br>

I feel a lump in my throat. I want to scream. Where is my body?<br><br>

Sinking. Sinking.<br><br>

Those eyes! Fuck! Those eyes!<br><br>

Awake. There's light again. It's the morning. Time to go and be productive.  I<br>
drag myself to the kitchen and drink coffee I don't remember making. I drag<br>
myself to the bus station and live a life I don't remember asking for.<br><br>

He is still here.<br>
<i>I feel it.</i><br><br>

I've made several posts on the net about that fucker that I keep seeing. No one<br>
has any ideas. I've talked to my therapist about it. It's almost like she<br>
doesn't hear me when I tell her.<br><br>

As I ride the bus to class I still feel his eyes. <i>Those eyes!</i><br>
