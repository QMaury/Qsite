Consciousness outpacing biology

================================================================================

Society and technology are far outpacing our biology, leading us having a hard
time keeping up with systems and paradigms that we invented. The things we
invent progressing faster than outselves, meaning that <i>thought</i> moves
faster than evolution. 

I think that the fact our thoughts move faster than evolution accounted for is
evidence that consciousness is an inherent law of the universe and of being.
Our consciousness isn't necessarily a by-product of our brains, rather,
consciousness already being everywhere and our biology and psychology act as
tools to emote consciousness that was already there. A conduit to express
emotions that couldn't otherwise be expressed in a physical 3D space.

(that last point relates strongly with metaphysical (lacking of a better term)
'emotional dimensions' of being. If that sounds like something you want to
