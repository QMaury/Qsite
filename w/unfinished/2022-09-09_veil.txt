Blind to Greater Aspirations

================================================================================

I can't help but feel that western society as a whole is being stifled by
commercialism, consumerism and modernity in general. At my place of work, I
occasionally get a strange feeling that everything is wrong. That there is a
veil over mine and everyone else's eyes, blinding us from some truth. When I
look around at the people shopping and exchanging currency and looking for
nice clothes, I feel that this isn't our purpose. There has to be a better
reason for our being here -- in the universe; existing -- than to consume
commercial products. The whole of of western society has been convinced that
our purpose is to consume, rather than seeking truths, seeking enlightenment.
Advertising companies have redefined the meaning of 'want' to serve their own
monetary interests. The amount of harm this perversion will cause to our
collective psychological and spiritual health still has yet to be fully
realized.
